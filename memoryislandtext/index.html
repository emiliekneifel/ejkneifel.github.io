welcome to memory island<br>
we want you to touch everything<br>
before we touch down <br>
on where x marks the spot <br>
<br><br>
thank you for being here with us together<br>
thank you annie and gallery tpw<br>
thank you ocad for the grant which has made gathering possible<br>
turtle island<br>
specifically here <br>
the traditional and ancestral territory of<br>
the mississaugas of the credit <br>
the haudenosaunee<br>
the anishinaabe<br>
the huron wendat<br>
<br><br>
this place, <br>
roughly <br>
“where the trees are standing in the water”<br><br>
or possibly<br>
“gathering place”<br>
“plenty”<br>
its buried tributaries and rivers<br>
its shoreline arfiticially constructed<br>
by colonial industry<br>
and yet as candice hopkins writes, which<br>
“eludes colonial cartography and control”<br>
because “even soil isn’t fixed”<br>
<br><br>
even soil isnt fixed<br>
it builds into a mound of our own creation<br>
memory island builds into a mound of our own attention<br>
<br><br>
we want this world to feel open<br>
and real because it is yours<br>
<br><br>
we want you to touch everything<br>
Rocks<br>
Flowers maddie <br>
Food claire <br>
Nik poster <br>
Wishes to donate <br>
<br>
finally thank you to lily <br>
My friend of truest heart <br>
<br><br>
welcome to memory island<br>
we want you to touch everything<br>

CASON SHARPES'S INTRODUCTION
 <br>

when lily and i were dreaming about hosting <br>
we were walking in the middle of the street in the middle of the night<br>
we wanted to invite people we would feel comfortable and excited introducing<br>
for me the answer immediately and clearly was cason<br>
<br><br>
every time i think of cason, everything else gets pulled up
<br>
this eliza niemi line, "i never met someone up close whose songs i thought were good"<br>
cason was my first art writer i felt some human proximity to <br>
he caught in tight knots what falls through <br>
<br><br>
this thing my crush once said about being funny and right <br>
i think cason is both funny and right <br>
and that what links these two is a rigour of precision of noticing<br>
he understands what a moment is <br>
  <br><br>
which translates, too, to the choreography of his performance<br>
<br><br>
the real luck of being alive right now and knowing or knowing of cason is the chance to get to see him perform <br>
bc he is a true performer <br>
<br><br>
in a completely different context from this, <br>
i saw him perform a life changing rendition of video games by lana del ray at owls club karaoke <br>
 he twirled the mic wire and we went with it <br>
<br><br>
his own words echo <br>
in one column he wrote about house of wax: <br>
"there’s some vague messaging about good eggs, bad apples, and the redemption of black sheep, but the most coherent idea House of Wax manages to communicate is that some people are nice, some people are mean, and some people are twins."
<br>
some people are nice, some people are mean, some people are twins, some people are funny, some people are right, some people are cason
<br>
and i feel so lucky to get to invite him to the pitchers mound <br> 
welcome, cason

        [IMAGE DESCRIPTION: a gum pink, bright olive and mint green line drawing of two amorphous, mostly-limbed, headless creatures. the one on the left has four limbs and is somersaulting into itself clockwise. it has three rocks: the smallest lodged in a knee, the medium one held in the sole of a foot. the biggest, glowing rock is what the figure is somersaulting around. the creature on the right has three complete limbs and a few which might be turning into the hot reflection of water. this creature is also shifting clockwise, but in a way that looks more similar to a backflip.]

 We wrote down; we wrote aloud. We wrote alone; we wrote together. For three<br> 
months, from 10:30-11:30 on Wednesdays, we were an ebb and flow - we were a<br> 
writing group.<br> 
   <br>
We built the workshop structure together: First, we wrote alone, shared, then<br> 
compiled lines into a collective poem on a huge sheet of paper. Sometimes, we<br> 
transformed that poem: by replacing all the I’s with we’s (9), or every noun for love<br> 
(13). Quickly, our structure became a loop: each week, we began by reading the past<br> 
week’s collective poem aloud.<br> 
   <br>
We tried some other tricks, too: One week, everyone chose a word to repeat in their<br> 
own work - goals, stuff, shout, stress, in my living room, together - which we then<br> 
used to write our collective poem (10). We wrote some poems aloud, too, going<br> 
around, person by person, line by line, lemon by lemon (3, 11).<br> 
   <br>
You may notice certain phrases, some big blue windows, return. Rachel often copied<br> 
down our past collective poems and shared them aloud, tossing them back into our<br> 
new work, reminding us, like any good loop, of our own repetition.<br> 
   <br>
This zine, like our group, was built together. Paul drew the shoes and forgiveness<br> 
mirror; Tomorrow drew the stuff map. Maria drew the love.<br> 
We wrote the poems. Us! We were the loop. Together.<br>

ALL THE BIRDS WE HEAR IN TREES BUT NEVER SEE comes from the art writer Durga Chew-Bose’s 93-page essay, “Heart Museum,” in which she catalogues a childhood of memorizing faces, paintings in books, the smell of a movie still, in order “to repossess,” “to confuse repossession with the distraction it allowed,” to repeat repossession, like her father repeats his stories, until “memories develop their own rhythm.” The title of her book, “Too Much and Not the Mood,” is itself a line from Virginia Woolf’s diaries. </font>

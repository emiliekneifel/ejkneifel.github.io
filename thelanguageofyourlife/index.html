 We wrote down; we wrote aloud. We wrote alone; we wrote together. For three<br> 
months, from 10:30-11:30 on Wednesdays, we were an ebb and flow - we were a<br> 
writing group.<br> 
   <br>
We built the workshop structure together: First, we wrote alone, shared, then<br> 
compiled lines into a collective poem on a huge sheet of paper. Sometimes, we<br> 
transformed that poem: by replacing all the I’s with we’s (9), or every noun for love<br> 
(13). Quickly, our structure became a loop: each week, we began by reading the past<br> 
week’s collective poem aloud.<br> 
   <br>
We tried some other tricks, too: One week, everyone chose a word to repeat in their<br> 
own work - goals, stuff, shout, stress, in my living room, together - which we then<br> 
used to write our collective poem (10). We wrote some poems aloud, too, going<br> 
around, person by person, line by line, lemon by lemon (3, 11).<br> 
   <br>
You may notice certain phrases, some big blue windows, return. Rachel often copied<br> 
down our past collective poems and shared them aloud, tossing them back into our<br> 
new work, reminding us, like any good loop, of our own repetition.<br> 
   <br>
This zine, like our group, was built together. Paul drew the shoes and forgiveness<br> 
mirror; Tomorrow drew the stuff map. Maria drew the love.<br> 
We wrote the poems. Us! We were the loop. Together.<br>

  THE LANGUAGE OF YOUR LIFE 𓅪ོ𓅪<br>
  These poems were written collectively in Fall 2024 and by Paul,
Rosalee, Anne, Tomorrow, Nick, William, EJ, Jorge, Maria, Josh,
Ilan, Rachel, Peter, and more. <br>
Our weekly themes were sound, momentum, repetition,
renewal, truth, solidarity, love, fear, and forgiveness. <br>
We read work by Audre Lorde, Aracelis Girmay, Ross Gay,
Terrance Hayes, Billy-Ray Belcourt, Natalie Diaz, Zaina Alsous,
aja monet, Mohammed El-Kurd, bell hooks, Pablo Neruda,
Gwendolyn Brooks, and Mary Oliver. <br>
        We performed our work in December 2024 @ Wychwood Open Door
  <br> with generous support from Nicholas Brach <br>
           
  <br>

The title of this workshop and zine come from the poet June
Jordan, who writes,
“And so poetry is not a shopping list, a
casual disquisition on the colors of the sky, a soporific
daydream, or bumpersticker sloganeering. Poetry is a political
action undertaken for the sake of information, the faith, the
exorcism and the lyrical invention, that telling the truth makes
possible. Poetry means taking control of the language of your
life. Good poems can interdict a suicide, rescue a love affair and
build a revolution in which speaking and listening to somebody
becomes the first and last purpose to every social encounter.

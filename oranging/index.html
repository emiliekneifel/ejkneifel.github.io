    “HE WAS SECOND TO MAKE THE BABY FACE BUT HIS EYES WERE SO SAD. I DON’T KNOW IF I’D EVER SEEN HIM FROM A THREE QUARTER ANGLE. BUT HIS LIPS WERE JUST AS PINK. I DIDN’T WANT A KISS, I WAS JUST “CHECKING SOMETHING” AND I CAN’T REMEMBER WHAT, BUT I WASN’T LYING. AND SUDDENLY WE WERE SITTING SO FAR AWAY. WE HADN’T MOVED, BUT THE SPACE WAS BIGGER.“
     <br> <br>
    
ORANGING: AN EXPERIMENTAL, MOVEMENT BASED THEATRE PERFORMANCE. THE GAP BETWEEN EMOTION AND ITS EXPRESSION. 
    <br>After Renee Gladman's novel, Event Factory
<br>
    THE SHAPE OF THE MAKE OF THIS IS OVERLAP INTO ITSELF ALL THE TIME INTO. EVERYONE NAMED HERE HAS TOUCHED AT THE EDGE AND FLICKERED A NEW ITERATION. CONTINGENCIES TIP TO THE CASCADES, THE PILE. THE RIPPLES LIFT UP, THE LIFT UP.
<br>
SO THAT D FINDS THE FRUIT. SO THAT THE AURA, THE STRUCTURE. SO THAT N WAS THE RIBBONS. SO THAT THE SAND.

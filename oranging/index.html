    “HE WAS SECOND TO MAKE THE BABY FACE BUT HIS EYES WERE SO SAD. I DON’T KNOW IF I’D EVER SEEN HIM FROM A THREE QUARTER ANGLE. BUT HIS LIPS WERE JUST AS PINK. I DIDN’T WANT A KISS, I WAS JUST “CHECKING SOMETHING” AND I CAN’T REMEMBER WHAT, BUT I WASN’T LYING. AND SUDDENLY WE WERE SITTING SO FAR AWAY. WE HADN’T MOVED, BUT THE SPACE WAS BIGGER."

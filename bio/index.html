     my usual bio: ej kneifel, friend of a friend, in bed with their palms up.
          <br>

       a little more formal: ej kneifel is a friend of a friend, reviews editor at The Ex-Puritan, co-creator of P8s, ORANGING, CATCH.
   <br>
       very formal: EJ Kneifel is a poet and ekphrastic critic. Their art writing -- spanning music, literature, tv/film, and visual art -- has appeared regularly at Exclaim!, Adroit, Montreal Review of Books, PRISM International, and more. Their poetry has appeared at Canthius, Peach Mag, Hobart, LESTE, The Malahat Review, ARC, TIMBER, Bad Dog, Vallum, and more.** They are a film columnist at In the Mood Magazine, have written two other ekphrastic columns (Heartworms at Flypaper Lit and blueberries at The Town Crier), and are reviews editor at the literary magazine The Ex-Puritan, where they are building up a precedent for others' experimental forms. They are also the author of chapbook VIO-LETS (Anstruther Press 2023), co-creator of the collective poetry podcast, CATCH, web series, PLAYD8s, and movement-based theatre production, ORANGING. Their current manuscript, Grief Ankle, for which they were awarded OGS funding, formalizes ekphrasis as a method for tracking the patterns of sensory self-making through art objects.
